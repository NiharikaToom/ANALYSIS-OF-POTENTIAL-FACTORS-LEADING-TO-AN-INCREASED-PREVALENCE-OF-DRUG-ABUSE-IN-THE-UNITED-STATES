# ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL FACTORS LEADING TO AN INCREASED PREVALENCE OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES.
This Project seeks to find a link between socio-economic and demographic factors that lead to drug use in the United States to
predict risk factors for drug usage from NSDUH Dataset extracted and analyzed using python and SQL.
Demonstrated link between long-term drug use and health factors using correlation analysis. Tested the idea of gateway drugs to
see if early usage of drugs like marijuana leads to harder drugs later in life.
Compared performance using predictive analysis of different machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest,
na√Øve bayes, XG BOOST ) and predicted substance abuse for different socio-economic factors and found that XG BOOST
performed well for the dataset.
